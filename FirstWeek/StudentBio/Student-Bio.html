			<p>Ever since he was young, Jacob Deming has always wanted to be a designer. Lacking in any kind of artistic talent beyond drawing stick figures, however, Jacob found himself writing and designing new and exciting games for his friends. Most of them were terrible and not very well thought-out, but that did not matter. Jacob had found his calling. Now he is learning how to code for webpages as yet another step in his journey as a game developer.</p>
